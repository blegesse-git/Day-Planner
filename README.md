# Day-Planner
This project is a simple daily planner that allows user to visually analyze the date and time based on color. Current time of the day shows red, future is highlighted in green, and past is in red. 
With a click of 'Save' button, user can store their input and have access to it even after closing the browser. 
The current date is always present and updated.
